**Task 1** - Iris Flowers Classification ML Project

The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data

Task 2 - Image to Pencil Sketch with Python

Read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image. We can finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. 

Task 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset - Terrorism

To do analysis and see the trends on terror attacks on different criteria

Task 4 - Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is that if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly

Task 5 - Develop A Neural Network That Can Read Handwriting

Project with the MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Challenge and using Tensorflow and CNN
